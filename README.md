## Datasets
- We received data extracts from FDOHâ€™s STARS in a fully de-identified format according to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). For replication purposes, a STARS data request to the [FDOH] can be made according to state, federal regulations and compliance with required ethical and privacy policies, including IRB approval by FDOH and execution of data user agreement. Requests are independently reviewed by FDOH.

## Usage examples
- Train models  
The frameworks of inductive learning task and transductive learning task are included in [dl] and [dl_time] respectively. Both of them support training GCN and GIN models. 

Example commands 
```sh
# train a GIN model
python main.py --model 'gin' --model_num 0 --batch_size 32 --init_lr 0.001 --min_lr 1e-6
```
